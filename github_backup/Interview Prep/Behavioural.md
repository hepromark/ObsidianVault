As a kid, I've always been interested in math. It was pretty common in Asia for parents to sign their kids up for tutoring programs (Kumon in my case), and I guess it stuck. 

In Canadian HS, I took pretty well to physics and chemistry, so following in my Dad's footsteps I chose mechanical engineering at Waterloo. 

Looking back now, I had no idea why I chose that major- I did not enjoy mechanical design one bit! And pretty quickly in my first year I knew that I wanted to work in software.

I still loved math and wanted to see my impact on the physical world, so I guess robotics was the natural answer. 

Robotics led me to Tokyo, where I met some amazing people and my time truly changed who I am. 

My internship was at a Start-up that made warehouse robots, where I worked initially on planning algorithms and the world model. It was very cool working on the MVP -> actual product stage, I got to see my algorithms affect real workers who use our robots. Once the product was stable, my mentor let me scope and define my own project, which led to the optimization pipeline that I made using Genetic Algorithms.

Coming back to Canada, I joined an autonomous racing team at its start (4 members), I volunteered to take leadership and grow the team. After 5 months, I've pitched and received funding to start building our car, designed the autonomy architecture. We're building out our SLAM modules right now. 

I've also been admitted to a research lab to improve their current visual SLAM system. Instead of doing COLMAP offline, I'm researching & implementing SOTA deep learning models that do end-to-end visual SLAM on their drone.

Yeah, and that's where I am right now.
