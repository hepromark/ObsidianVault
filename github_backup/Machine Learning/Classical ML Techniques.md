## Gaussian Mixture Models: Used in [[WARG Clustering]]

Probabilistic model that that assumes data points generated from a **mixture** of *finite Gaussian distributions* with unknown parameters

Is a generalization of the K-means algorithm:
- Allows model to adapt to 'oval' shaped clusters, i.e. having a covariance matrix that is N x N

Dimensionality Reduction

SVM

ELM
