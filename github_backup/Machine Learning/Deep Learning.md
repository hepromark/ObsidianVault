What is Deep Learning?
- A subset of Machine Learning where [[Neural Networks]] are used as universal function approximators that maps inputs to outputs.
- Parameters of the neural network is "automatically" (not hand) tuned by optimizing some cost function.

Why use Deep Learning?
- With enough data to learn from (run the cost function over then optimize), neural networks can approximate *any* function
- Modern computing power ↑ and available data ↑ making hand tuning not needed.
