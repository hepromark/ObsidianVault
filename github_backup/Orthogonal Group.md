### Overview
The orthogonal group, $O(n)$ is the group of distance-preserving transformations of a Euclidean space of dimension $n$ that preserve a fixed point.

Example:
$SO(3)$ is the special orthogonal group for $n =3$. 
- It is the group of all rotations in 3D space, i.e. 3x3 orthogonal matrices with determinant 1 (hence 'special')
- Each matrix satisfies:
	- Orthogonality Condition: $R^TR = I$, which means rows and columns of R are orthonormal vectors, preserving angles and lengths after the transformation
	- Determinant Condition: $det(R) = 1$, so that the 'space' resulting from transformation is unchanged (if $det(R) = -1$ then a reflection exists)
	- which gives: $SO(3)={R∈R3×3 ∣ R^TR=I, det(R)=1}$
