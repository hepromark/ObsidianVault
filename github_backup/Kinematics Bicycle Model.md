Instantaneous center of rotation (ICR)
- Consider a rigid body performing a planar motion → ex: Vehicle driving on a flat road
        
- Picking a reference point `r0`, some arbitrary point `r` has velocity:
- $\dot{r} = \dot{r_0} + \Omega \times (r - r_0)$
- This means that we can pick a point `r0` such that the instantaneous movement of ANY point in the car is just a rotation about that `r0` point (called the ICR).
- This means that we can pick a point r0 such that the instantaneous movement of ANY point in the car is just a rotation about that r0 point (called the ICR).

- Extending this to wheels, the car having 4 wheels which are rotating with respect to the ICR and is also slipping. Slipping occurs when velocity of a wheel center (red) does not coincide with the orientation of the wheel (dashed) → red line not same as dashed line.

The Bicycle Model simplifies this into 2 wheels, with no slipping.
