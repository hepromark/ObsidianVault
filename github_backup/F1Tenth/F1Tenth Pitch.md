I'm Mark, the Micro Autonomy Lead for WATO. 
- This is the F1Tenth competition:
	- It's a 1/10th scale autonomous racing cup,
	- where our members write all the autonomy algorithms for our car to race itself.
	- F1Tenth comps are held at the most prestigious research conferences globally- big companies like Amazon Robotics, Apple, Google, all attend.
	
- Our software is ready to go! In the last 4 months, we have developed and tested our autonomy algorithms in simulation. 
- so All that's left is hardware!
- We just need these 2 items
	- Lidar
	- Jetson
- funded to assemble our car.
- These items are a both *competition standard* and a *one time purchase*. We got partial funding last term so once we are funded this term the parts will be purchased immediately.
- After that we're ready to attend competition in Atlanta 2 months from now.
