Notes:
I've founded and am leading an autonomous race car team at Waterloo. It was super interesting to do background literature research on the technical side (software stack, algorithms, etc.), and learn to do budgeting, marketing to new members, and pitching to my schools' endowment funds for capital to actually buy hardware. I'm 5 months in and the team is going strong; I designed a pretty traditional perception-behaviour-controls software stack and my members and I have been testing our car in simulation. We're assembling the actual car soon too!

Ever since high school, I've been involved in financial literacy. I have a strong opinion that everyone should have a baseline knowledge of how money works in the modern world, how to invest for personal financial stability, and taxes. Education is important, and I think wealthsimple embodies this goal pretty well- your platform is easy to navigate and it encourages young adults like myself to take a more active role in our finances.
