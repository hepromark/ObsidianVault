What?
- A software project that implements behaviour trees and controls.

Why spend time on this?
- Solidify / prove WATO knowledge (WATO experience amounted to nothing)
- Have a big project that I can say I myself did alone entirely
- Can actually justify going into autonomous / self-driving fields
- Still have 4 months of progress before applications
- "General experience across the robotics software stack, including controls, kinematics, motion planning, and rigid transformations / 3D geometry"


Learning Objectives
- Discrete time implementation of control theory
- Implementation of behaviour trees

Software Objectives
1. Setup a low-resource version of CARLA for controls & behaviour testing
2. Get simple lane following movement working.
