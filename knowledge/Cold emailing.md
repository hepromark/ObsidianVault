#### Teleo: 
- Industrial, autonomy for a wide variety of vehicles
Hi Marcin,

I'm searching for a fall 2025 internship, and I've been following Teleo for almost a year now. I find Teleo's software for industrial machinery to be an extremely interesting problem to work on and I have been working hoping to intern there.

I have done 3 previous internships, most recently working on planning algorithms for a warehouse robotics startup in Tokyo. I'm also current leading an autonomous racing (F1Tenth) team at my school. Through all my work I've grown to enjoy writing algorithms for a variety of machines (I've worked on storage robots, cars & drones) so being able to work on your diverse vehicle fleet as an internship is a dream. 

My CV is attached above. If my work interests you, would you be willing to consider me for a quick call or forward my resume to a respective recruiter? 

Thank you for your time,
Mark Do

#### Lucid Bots
- Cleaning automation

#### Ambi Robotics
- Warehouse robotics
- Stacking robots- fancy grabbing thing

Hi ,

I'm searching for a fall 2025 internship, and I've been following Ambi for around a year now. I find Ambi's robots for warehouse automation very interesting and I have been working hoping to intern there.

I have done 3 previous internships, most recently doing warehouse robotic task scheduling for a startup in Tokyo, where I interfaced between the Warehouse Management System and their fleet of warehouse robots.

I'm also current leading an autonomous racing (F1Tenth) team at my university. Through all my work I've grown to love applying algorithms to solve real world problems, and found that industrial robots combine theory and practice in the coolest way possible. Being able to work on cutting-edge warehouse robots at one of the most promising warehouse robotic startups right now as an intern would be a dream.

My CV is attached above. If my work interests you, would you be willing to consider me for a quick call or forward my resume to a respective recruiter? 

Thank you for your time,

#### Reliable Robotics
- Autopilot / automation for aircrafts
- Want entire flight to be automated

Hi Marcus,

I'm Mark, a 3rd year undergrad at the University of Waterloo for Mechatronics Engineering and I've been following Reliable Robotics for a few years. I find Reliable's autonomy for planes an extremely interesting project to work on and I have been working hoping to intern there for a while now.

I have done 3 previous internships, most recently working on planning algorithms for a warehouse robotics startup in Tokyo. I'm also current leading an autonomous racing team at my school, and previously written autonomy software for an unmanned drone. Through all my work I've grown to love developing autonomous systems, so being able to work on one of the coolest flight software stacks as an intern is a dream. 

My CV is attached above. If my work interests you, would you be willing to consider me for a quick call or forward my resume to a respective recruiter? 

Thank you for your time Marcus,

#### Lucid Bots

Hi Hartley,

I'm searching for a fall 2025 internship, and I've been following Lucid bots for several years now. I find Lucid Bot's cleaning robots very interesting, and I have been working hoping to intern there for a while.

I have done 3 previous internships, most recently working on planning algorithms for a warehouse robotics startup in Tokyo. I'm also current leading an autonomous racing team at my school, and previously written unsupervised learning algorithms for an autonomous drone. Through all my work I've grown to love developing robotic systems, so being able to work on any of your platforms as an intern is a dream. 

If you are interested, I have attached my resume above.

Thank you and have a great day!

#### Pal Robotics "letter to recruiter":

Hello, I'm Mark! I was researching potential sponspors for my University's autonomous robotics team when I came across Pal Robotics as one of ICRA 2023's partners. I saw that Pal Robotics had an AMR robot and a long history of developing humanoid robotics, which aligned perfectly with my previous experience developing AMRs, as well as my current interest in Humanoid Robots. It's always been a dream of mine to work at an established robotics company with a culture of pushing the boundaries of what's currently possible, and working at Pal as an intern would be a dream. I am confident my previous experience in AMRs and passion for robotics will make a difference in your team. Thank you.

#### VIAM

Hi _,

I'm Mark & I'm searching for a fall 2025 internship. I find Viam's integration platform fascinating, and I have been working hoping to intern there for a while now. 

I have done 3 previous internships, most recently working on backend algorithms for a robotics startup in Tokyo. I'm also currently lead my schools autonomous racing team, where I created our entire dockerized simulator & deployment system, with additional experience with DevOps on large server clusters. Through all my work I believe that an unified cloud platform is the most efficient way to do any type of engineering, so working on the Viam Platform as an intern would be a dream. 

If you are interested, I have attached my resume above.

Thank you and have a great day!
