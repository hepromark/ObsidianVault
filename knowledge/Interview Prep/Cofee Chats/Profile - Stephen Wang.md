Mechatronics Engineering Grad 2024 (3 years older) at Oxa

**Previous Internships:**
- Mechatronics -> 2 ML coops -> IoT -> Robotics for crack filling
- A wide array of experience, interesting how he went from Mechatronics to ML then back (I don't know anyone who really does this)

**Cool projects**:
- Additive manufacturing (auto crack repair) at coop
- TCLAS: Testing infrastructure
- RTLS: Real-time location service

**Commonalities**:
- WATcloud:
	- Worked on IaC ansible repo
	- Helped install big data server
- Mechatronics Engineering Program

### **Questions**

> Â I like developing novel solutions that combine state-of-the-art machine learning techniques and classical control theory
- Personally, is there anything that draws you to controls specifically (ex: as compared to perceptions, or motion planning lets say)
- I am at a crossroads in my learning- I'm leading a subproject of Watonomous to do autonomous racing
- I could potentially help out / learn about any of these 3, but I'm having trouble making up my mind (they all seem cool ðŸ˜¥)

> Graduate Software Engineer (Controls)
- How did you get this position?
- What does a controls engineer usually do?
	- I know it probably varies job to job, but my last workplace (RR) I knew the control engineers there. Our robot were pretty simple mechanically so it was Kalman Filter + PID for a line following robot
	- Oxa is developing a platform for self-driving? Do you work on a specific vehicle or more broad? 

> 6 different coops, not a single overlap / 8 month position
- Was it spooky trying to find a graduate position?
- Did you consider going back?
- How was the grad job search
- I'm on my 5th coop soon, and I'm starting to get nervous thinking about the current market + grad job search

> Mechatronics Engineering
- Any courses you specifically enjoyed? Any controls courses (apart from the mandatory MTE___) worth taking?
