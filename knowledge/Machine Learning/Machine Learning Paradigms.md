#### What is Machine Learning?
- Machine Learning is a subset of Artificial Intelligence that uses algorithms / statistical models to solve problems without being explicitly programmed a solution by a human. 

#### Categories of Machine Learning
1. [[Supervised Learning]]
Learning from labelled data. A 'correct answer' is available for all the given data.

2. [[Unsupervised Learning]]
Learning from unlabeled data. Model finds patterns in unlabeled data. 

3. [[Semi-supervised]] / Self-supervised Learning
Learning from partially labeled data or the model generates its own label internally. 

4. [[Reinforcement Learning]]
Learning from maximizing a reward signal by interacting with an 'environment'.

|               | Data Required | Algorithm Complexity | Hand-tuning                                                        | Problem Complexity |
| ------------- | ------------- | -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------ |
| Classical ML  | Low           | High                 | Yes - feature engineering, dim. reduction, etc.                    | Simple problems    |
| Deep Learning | High          | Low                  | No - end to end DL models are available depending on how much data | Complex problems   |
