How MEF works:
- Buy it myself + get re-imbursed
- We can pay for it from team account, then MEF -> reimbursed from there

Purchases:
- Send link to cart + and itll get delivered to the bay / office
- Supplier: ask them for a quote, get PDF attachment of a quote
	- Procurement will pay for it and delivered directly and payed from our account
- We can also send our purchases from the WEEF account
- We can see ourselves
